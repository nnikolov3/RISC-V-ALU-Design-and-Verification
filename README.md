# RISC-V-ALU-Design-and-Verification

This project implements and verifies an RV32I Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using SystemVerilog and the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). 
The ALU supports essential RISC-V 32I operations, including arithmetic (e.g., addition, subtraction), logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, XOR), and control for branches and jumps. 
The UVM testbench ensures comprehensive verification, covering functionality, edge cases, pipeline interactions, exceptions, and reset behavior.

Key components include the ALU design, a UVM environment with agents, drivers, monitors, scoreboards, and coverage collectors, plus scripts for formatting and simulation. 
The goal is a robust, fully verified ALU ready for integration into a larger RISC-V processor design.

Enjoy exploring the code!
